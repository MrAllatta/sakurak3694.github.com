This is where you write your reflection.
This week i felt was better then last week because i felt like i learned a lot more for example i learned what some of the main function such as <div> defines a section in a document and <a> defines a hyper link those are the main ones that i didnt know before. After we learned about what differemt types of function meant we choose a flag to focus on so i try to choose a more easier flag so i have a better chance of being able to do it. So the flag i choose is the idonesia flag whcih is really simple just red and white. Today we tryede to make our flag with construction paper glue and sissors but there was no more red so i just used orange. I think next week we are supposed to code the flag we choose.
