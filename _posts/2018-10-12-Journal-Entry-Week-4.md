This week we only had 3 days of computer science since we didnt have school on monday but i felt like i was preety productive. We learned how to make some simple shapes such as circles and squares on pyret which we have been using over the last 2 weeks. We also kind of reviviewed how to customize the squares and circles sizes. we were doing partner programming and we were supposed to code the pictures and directions on this spread sheet. In partner programming there is 2 roles. One of them is the driver who is responsible for controlling the keyboard and mouses and the other is the navigator who checks for mistakes the driver did. We only got to the thired step because we ran out of time but it was a good learning experience. usually in computer science i have a hard time understanding concepts so i take a long time to do simple stuff that other would be able to quickly. I think next week we are supposed to personalize are blogs so i am intrested  for how u do that.
