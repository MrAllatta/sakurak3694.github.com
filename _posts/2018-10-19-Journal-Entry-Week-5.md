ae-cb= place-image(cb,200,200,ae)

This week in computer science we coded are flags that we chosed. My flag was one of the more easier flags since it is the indonesian flag it is just red on top and white on the bottom. After i completed coding my flag and it works i saved the image in a folder and then draged the image into git hub. The code above is to just make the rectangles for the indonesian flag. Line 9 is for the red part of the flag and line 10 is for the white part of the flag which is kind of hard to see since its white. Line 11 was kind of hard i needed help with it because you have to combine the two rectangles. It was hard for me to code because for the rectangles its the same pattern but when ur trying to code so that the rectangles combine i didnt really know what to code. Without the code in step 11 there is just a red rectangle and a white rectangle that is seperated. So step 11 code connects the two rectangles.
