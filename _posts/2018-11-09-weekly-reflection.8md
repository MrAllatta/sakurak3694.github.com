This week we focused a lot on making workable functions using contracts. Some of the ways the teacher taught us so we may understand it better is by using charts and labeling them depending on what the problem is. I learned that the contract is very important in making a function because if you dont understand the contract you will not know what numbers to put inside the parenthesis. I noticed that in the past 2 weeks the the teachers used charts to help us understand. I think he uses charts because it is organized and you can see what items are in each catagories. I always get confused when asked to create a function because i dont understand the concept of the contract.
