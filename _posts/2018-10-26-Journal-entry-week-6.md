This week we started our new unit which is learning about data science.  We learned about tables and what each part of the table stands for.  For example if u think of a column the right side is the data rows were the numbers are. The left side is where the names are. So once we understood the way the tables work we read a bunch of random data and we were supposed to make a table and plot in the numbers. We achieved this by coding in based on what the data is saying. I was uncessesful at doing this because i was very confused on how to edit the columns and how to code the tables with the numbers you want in it. In this journal entry the big idea we are supposed to write about is connections so my connection is relating computer science to algebra. Computer science realates to alebra because in computer science you assign names to numbers and other data similar to how you give variable names such as x and y for math.
