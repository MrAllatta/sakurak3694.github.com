This week we did a lot of different types of things. We started of the week with reviewing two circle of evaluations and comparing and contrasting it. This week the big ideas are contracts,definition,functions,application and data. Personally i do not understand the diffrennce beteween these terms. Thinking about thses big ideas towards the middle of the week we worked on making new functions and editing the names and numbers that go into that function.
