This week we did a lot of different types of things. We started of the week with reviewing two circle of evaluations and comparing and contrasting it. This week the big ideas are contracts,definition,functions,application and data. Personally i do not understand the diffrennce beteween these terms. Thinking about thses big ideas towards the middle of the week we worked on making new functions and editing the names and numbers that go into that function. One example was # 0. Design a function called double, which takes in a number and doubles it. And i wrote double :: (n :: Number) -> Number. To me this is kind of a confusing way to look at it i uderstand things a lot better when its numbers and math symbols these puntiation throw me of. Since in these contracts u usually have to write letters for numbers and punctuation. In the future I hope to try to understand the concept of punctiation in the parenthesis because i think learning how to read the contracts are really important in uderstanding the class.
