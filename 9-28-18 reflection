This week has been decent. In the beggining of the week we learned about coordinates so we know where to locate things in a coordinate 
table and we can be specific. Towards the middle of the week we was coding on this new website called pyrote. I still have to finish my 
blog from last week on git hub because i did all the steps but when i type in my username for git hub it still dosent come up so i have to 
figure out why. This class has always been hard and confusing to me. I ask for help to a lot of different people.
